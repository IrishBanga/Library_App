REFLECTION

Overall, this workshop was easy to code, but I faced major issues during the debugging procedure.
 
Initially, I didn’t understand some of the code syntax provided in the Line class definition. So, I changed 
it a bit and moved the Line constructor to the main implementation file. Apart from that, I had issues with 
the syntax of function definitions for which I referred to the class notes.
 
The functions were small in the implementation and performed simple actions with a few exceptions such as the 
view() function. I also added a custom function init() to set TextFile objects to an empty state.

Reading from and writing to files was done in a way similar to that in the tester function. Also, this was 
the first time we made use of the string class. I used its length() and c_str() methods to correctly allocate 
memory and set the filename.  

Once fully implemented, the program gave access violation errors, warning messages, and run-time errors 
(HEAP corruption etc.) and sometimes exited with different error codes after displaying the correct output. 
Apart from that, I had a considerable memory leak and various invalid reads and writes which I only discovered 
through the Matrix tester. Debugging didn’t prove much helpful as VS debugger would jump to different system 
files after each run. 
Finally, I reviewed my code against the instructions and was able to resolve the issue, which was caused 
because of not setting the number of lines before calling the loadText() function in the copy constructor.
