I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

REFLECTION

The first part of the workshop was relatively easy as it was a simple re-arranging of code. But because I used namespaces 
for the first time I faced errors related to scoping. I also had doubts regarding the usage of namespaces in header files 
apart from the main implementation files which I resolved by discussing with my professor.

One specific issue I faced with the File.h was that some of the functions used a parameter of type struct ShoppingRec 
in their declarations. Initially, I included the header file ShoppingRec.h in File.h. Later, I used a forward declaration 
of the struct as a workaround to comply with the workshop instructions.  

Most functions in the DIY were simple but I had difficulty coding the strtr() function. The function is supposed to return 
the address of the sub-string match upon success and a nullptr in case of an unsuccessful search. I initially declared a 
char* as nullptr but it wouldn't let me insert the address into the variable. Eventually, I used a conditional expression 
based on a flag(variable done in this case) in the return statement.
