I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

REFLECTION - Workshop

This workshop was comparatively easier and simple compared to the previous workshop.
Both the classes had a few member functions with very simple implementation. I have also become more comfortable 
using the global initialization method. I didn't face many issues with this workshop and only had minor issues 
associated with accessing data members of the base class. These issues were overcome instantly with the error 
messages from VS debugger.

Other than that, I had minor issues while matching the output and addCargo() function requirements.

REFLECTION - PROJECT MS1, MS2

MS1
The issue I faced with this milestone was getting the date input from the user(in the specified format). The instructions 
stated using cin.ignore() function but I used a temporary character to store the separator or the digit(in case the user 
entered the date with whitespaces). I used the ASCII values to determine if they were valid digits to make appropriate changes 
to the input in date values.
Also, I had to develop a helper function daysDiff() for my overloaded comparison operators as they couldn't access use the
daysSince0001_1_1() function directly.

The Menu class implementation was easy and the global initialization helped a lot.
However, I faced issues with the destructor which caused memory leaks.

MS2

This milestone was similar to the current workshop, simple with clear and concise instructions.
I initially had some doubts regarding the constructor of LibApp(), but was able to resolve them eventually.
The suggested pseudo code provided in the instructions made it easier to implement the run() function used in the LibApp() class.
