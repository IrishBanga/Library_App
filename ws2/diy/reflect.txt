I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

REFLECTION

The lab portion of this workshop introduced overloading functions and dynamic memory. I had various problems with the syntax 
of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation as well as the logic related to the copying of employee name(s). These were 
resolved upon discussion with my professor during the lab session.

I had minor issues with the overloaded read() functions as well. Two of these functions received a reference of the 
struct member variables as parameters. This was slightly different from passing their address(or pointers) so I had to refer 
to the relevant notes to get it right.

The DIY was very similar to the first part of the workshop and I built my solution on the same logic as before. I modified 
the sort() function provided earlier to sort the struct(Population) city array based on the population of the postal codes 
as well as the read() functions to match the record format in the PCPopulations.csv file.
