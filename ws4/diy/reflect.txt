I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

REFLECTION

The lab portion was implemented in a single class (Canister) and was easier compared to the DIY 
part(implemented in two different classes).
The lab portion had numerous and very specific instructions, some of which I overlooked while 
developing my solution and it was difficult to get the correct output later. Also, I faced a lot of 
memory-related issues with this workshop that were difficult to track. With the lab, I couldn’t 
figure out the cause of 1 unallocated block at the end of my program. This was resolved by calling 
the clear() function even before we allocated any new memory. It's a safe practice as all the Canister 
contents were set to empty states using constructors at the initialization stage.
With DIY, it was mostly minor errors, such as newline at the wrong place or off-by-one errors but took 
a lot of time to fix. The major issue I faced was the corruption of HEAP memory, which I’d never 
encountered before. I tried debugging the program and the error would show up only when the program 
execution reached the deconstructor stages. Initially, I assumed my logic of memory deallocation was 
wrong, but this was caused due to off-by-one logical error in copying label contents into the dynamic character array.
