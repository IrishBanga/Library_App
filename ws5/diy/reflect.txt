REFLECTION

This workshop introduces member operators and helper operators.  I faced several issues with the 
syntax while coding these operators and subsequently while calling these operators. I had to refer 
to this weekâ€™s notes to get the syntax right, especially in the case of helper operators. The code 
provided in the workshop was also helpful to resolve most of the issues that I faced.

The DIY portion was very similar but had a different logic where the grade and scale were determined 
after a mark was assigned to the object or in the casting operators (where the return value is 
determined based on the validity of the Mark object). This prompted me to create two custom functions 
of my own: setSMG() and setInValid(). The implementation of these functions is simple and complements 
the logic of other operators as well. The setSMG() takes an integer value as an argument and 
initializes/sets an object to a valid mark, grade and scale using a series of if-else-if statements 
or calls setInValid() if the integer value is invalid.
